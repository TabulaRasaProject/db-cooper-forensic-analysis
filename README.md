# D.B. Cooper Necktie Particle Analysis (Summary)

This repository contains a technical analysis derived from previously published
forensic examinations of the D.B. Cooper necktie, including work by Tom Kaye et al.,
McCrone Associates, and the FBI Seattle Field Office.

## Purpose
- Synthesize existing particle-analysis findings
- Assess occupational and industrial implications
- Evaluate geographic probability under historical manufacturing constraints

This work does not propose a suspect or claim the case is solved.

## High-Level Findings
- 91,369 particles cataloged from the necktie (McCrone, 2017)
- 65.4% silicon + calcium composition
- Particle ratios consistent with paper manufacturing environments
- Aerospace, steel, electronics, and construction profiles excluded
- Fox Valley (WI) ranks highest under industrial and geographic constraints

## Contents
- `paper/` – full technical paper
- `references.md` – source list

## Status
Working research paper. Conclusions may be refined as additional critique
or historical data is considered.
