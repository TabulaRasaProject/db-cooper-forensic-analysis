## Executive Summary

Seeking to describe the occupation of the man who wore Cooper’s tie on a daily basis, this paper builds on prior forensic analysis by the Cooper Research Team (Kaye et al.), McCrone Associates, and the Seattle Field Office of the FBI. The analysis shows that the particle profile recovered from the D.B. Cooper necktie—comprising 91,369 individual particles—exhibits a diagnostic occupational fingerprint consistent with paper manufacturing.

The profile is dominated by silicon-rich (35.6%) and calcium-rich (29.8%) particles, producing a combined silicon–calcium composition of 65.4%. When considered alongside diagnostic industrial particles, including pure titanium, bismuth compounds, zinc dendrites, and silicon spheres, this evidence is most consistent with prolonged contact with an integrated pulp and paper mill environment. Geographic probability analysis further narrows the most likely region of employment to the Fox Valley of Wisconsin.

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Scope & Assumptions

For the purposes of this paper, it is assumed that the black, clip-on necktie recovered from seat 18E on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 on November 24, 1971 belonged to the hijacker, known as D.B. Cooper. Accordingly, the necktie is referred to throughout this document as “Cooper’s tie.”

This analysis relies on published forensic work by Kaye et al. (2009–2017), which characterized particle types, morphologies, and diagnostic materials recovered from the tie. Additional data derives from McCrone Associates’ 2017 automated SEM analysis and classification of 91,369 individual particles. These efforts significantly advanced the case, building upon earlier work by Special Agent Carr and the FBI Seattle Field Office.

The scope of this paper is to interpret the chemical signatures deposited on Cooper’s tie in order to characterize the wearer’s occupation and assess the most likely geographic region of employment.

### 1.2 Contribution of This Paper

Although the particles recovered from Cooper’s tie are invisible to the naked eye, collectively they document the industrial environments to which the tie was exposed. The central contribution of this paper is the demonstration that the combined particle ratios and rare particle assemblage are sufficiently distinctive in both type and quantity to constitute an occupational fingerprint consistent with the paper industry.

This paper does not reinterpret the underlying particle data. Rather, it synthesizes those findings with historical industrial practices and regional manufacturing structures to narrow occupational and geographic possibilities.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1 Occupational Fingerprint

Elemental analysis of Cooper’s tie reveals a non-random industrial particle signature dominated by silicon- and calcium-rich particulates, with secondary iron and trace specialty metals. This internally consistent distribution indicates routine occupational exposure rather than incidental environmental contact.

**Observed particle distribution:**
- 35.6% silicon-rich particles (~32,503)
- 29.8% calcium-rich particles (~27,249)
- 9.0% iron-rich particles (~8,206)
- 65.4% combined silicon + calcium

Trace particles of titanium, stainless steel, and aluminum alloys were also identified. Prior analysis by Kaye et al. notes that commercially pure titanium was rare in 1971 and largely confined to chemical processing, specialty manufacturing, and engineering contexts—environments compatible with supervisory or white-collar personnel wearing neckties.

### 2.2 Analysis: Paper Manufacturing

The diagnostic value lies not in individual elements, but in their relative proportions and coexistence. By the late 1960s, North American paper manufacturing had converged on a materials regime that systematically produced a silicon–calcium–iron particulate mix closely matching the Cooper tie profile.

Historical industry surveys indicate that calcium carbonate had become the dominant paper filler (≈70%), commonly used alongside silicon-rich materials such as kaolin clay and silicates, particularly in coated paper mills.

**Sources of particles in paper manufacturing:**

**Silicon (~35.6%)**
- Kaolin clay (aluminum silicate) coatings and fillers  
- Silica present in wood pulp and bark contaminants  
- Abrasion from silicon-carbide grinding equipment  
- Talc (magnesium silicate) in coating formulations  

**Calcium (~29.8%)**
- Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) filler  
- Kraft process recausticizing chemicals (Ca(OH)₂)  
- Calcium-bearing wood and recycled fiber contaminants  

**Iron (~9.0%)**
- Wear from steel tanks, rollers, and piping  
- Rust and corrosion products in humid mill environments  
- Maintenance and fabrication debris  

This paired silicon–calcium dominance with subordinate iron is a known byproduct of paper production chemistry and machinery, not a generic industrial background.

### 2.3 Industry Exclusion

Comparison with known industrial particle profiles excludes alternative sectors:

- **Aerospace:** Aluminum-dominated (>50% Al), typically <10% combined Si–Ca  
- **Steel / metallurgy:** Iron-dominated (>40% Fe), <20% Si–Ca  
- **Construction:** Calcium-heavy but with incompatible particle morphology  
- **Electronics / semiconductors:** Silicon-dominated (>60% Si) with minimal calcium  
- **Non-paper chemical plants:** Lack the characteristic paired Si–Ca filler signature  

No other industry consistently produces the balanced silicon–calcium ratio with subordinate iron observed on Cooper’s tie.

## 3. Geographic Probability Ranking

Geographic probability is determined not by proximity to the hijacking site, but by the historical presence of industrially mature paper-manufacturing ecosystems capable of producing the observed particulate signature.

By the late 1960s, only a limited number of U.S. regions combined:
- High-density paper manufacturing  
- On-site machine shops and metallurgical support  
- Engineering or supervisory roles compatible with necktie use  
- Access to corrosion-resistant specialty metals

### 3.1 Pacific Northwest (Washington / Oregon) — **High**

The Pacific Northwest possessed major paper mills and a dominant aviation sector in 1971. However, these industries operated in segregated occupational environments.

Aviation facilities were aluminum-dominated and chemically incompatible with the silicon–calcium–iron profile observed on Cooper’s tie. Conversely, regional paper mills were largely pulp- and commodity-focused, with limited calcium-carbonate coating operations and no documented aviation maintenance integration.

---

### 3.2 Fox Valley, Wisconsin (Neenah–Appleton–Green Bay) — **Highest**

The Fox Valley hosted the world’s highest concentration of paper mills during the relevant period, many of them fully integrated with coating lines, machine shops, and electroplating facilities.

Crucially, paper companies in the region operated aviation directly. Kimberly-Clark established a corporate flight department in 1948 and formalized K-C Aviation in 1969, creating a unified occupational environment in which personnel routinely moved between mills and aircraft hangars.

This integration plausibly accounts for:
- Persistent silicon–calcium exposure from coated-paper production  
- Secondary iron from heavy machinery and humid environments  
- Trace specialty metals from corrosion-resistant systems and aircraft maintenance  
- Occupational roles compatible with daily necktie use  

No comparable paper–aviation integration is documented in the Pacific Northwest during this period.

## 4. Conclusions

The 65.4% silicon–calcium ratio observed on Cooper’s tie is diagnostic of paper manufacturing and excludes most other industries. The Fox Valley ranks first not due to geographic convenience, but because it uniquely satisfies the chemical, industrial, and occupational constraints imposed by the physical evidence.

No other region demonstrates this convergence.
